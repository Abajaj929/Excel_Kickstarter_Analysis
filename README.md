# Kickstarter Analysis with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
To understand how different campaigns results in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Differences are shown with campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Kickstarters have successful outcomes 61% of the time. While the outcome varies each month, May is the most successful month and December is the least successful.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
85% of the Kickstarter goals were less than $10K. When the goal exceeds $20K, the likelihood of success decreases.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
No challenges encountered but without knowing Excel, one would not be able to get to these conclusions without knowing the formulas used and calculation conversions. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1.	Jan-Nov, there were more successful outcomes for Theater than failed and cancelled but December, there were comparable failed and successful outcomes.
2.	There were no cancelled outcomes in the month of October but rather a spike in failed outcomes.


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1.	The distribution percentage of failed vs successful outcomes varies based on goal. The outcome is worst when goal surpasses 45,000.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
1.	I don’t think it’s a lot of data to compare all the way back to 2009. The yearly amount of kickstarters varies from 14 to 1,225.
2.	There’s different country’s currencies in a single sheet and it doesn’t look like the exchange rates are considered in a column.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1.	% Pledge of Goal per Parent Category to see which category was most financially successful
2.	Success Outcomes by Country (and Failed Outcomes by Country to see where they can improve)
3.	Average Donation by Year
